Hi!

The end is coming and homeworks are done. To know how to use new RoboCompDSL utilities we need to create a simple and complete user manual.

This documentation can be found [here.](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/highlyunstable/tools/robocompdsl/README.md)

Initially I worked with **robocompdslROS** branch until we realize the [merge](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/commit/6120997bcae4677b1ad764485033d1288cfec32f).
After this, I have been working in **highlyunstable** branch, here is my [commit-list](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/commits/highlyunstable?author=Daniel1108).

Now, I finish my work and I want to say that I enjoyed and learned a lot with this project. I would also like to thank my mentors all the help they have given me and to Google Summer of Code for giving me this opportunity.

I hope to return to participate in some as exciting as this project next year.
