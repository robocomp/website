     rcbuild [-h] [-i | --doc | --installdoc] [component]

The `doc` will generate documentation, `installdoc` will install the docs to install path, `install` will build and install the components. currently you can only generate docs for one component at a time.

    rced [-h] component file


###rcrun
Using rcrun you can start, stop or force stop any component from anywhere. You can also start a component in debug mode, given you have the required *config file* in the *etc* directory. If you have specified a config file then rcrun will use it to start the component. By default rcrun will use the `config` config file in `etc` directory, if not found it will search for `generic_config` if not found it will use any of config files present.If the debug flag is set, it will search for a config file that ends with *.debug*.

    rcrun [-h] [-s START |-st STOP | -fst FSTOP] [-d | -cf CFILE | -c CONFIG] [-is] [component]


###rccd
Using this you can cd into the component directory given the component name.
